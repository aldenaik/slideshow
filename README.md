## Build a screenshot carousel!
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZenStef/zendev-test-new-grad/master/proto-carousel.png?token=2904853__eyJzY29wZSI6IlJhd0Jsb2I6WmVuU3RlZi96ZW5kZXYtdGVzdC1uZXctZ3JhZC9tYXN0ZXIvcHJvdG8tY2Fyb3VzZWwucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlcyI6MTQwMDc4ODMxN30%3D--0cf8fe9c0a6a3a2ceb4982f4b38295a5fbed2c8a)

### Getting Started
- git clone https://github.com/ZenStef/zendev-test-new-grad.git
- Create a new branch for your code
- When you're all finished add/push/commit your code and submit a pull request for your branch to be merged into master
- Assign the pull request to me: ZenStef

### Data Provided
- *assets/scripts/carouselData.js* - JSON Data stored in a variable labeled screenCarousel. The data stored here contains URL's to each screenshot image, the title of the screen, the description of the screen, and the absolute positioning specs for your tooltip (which conatins the description) 
- *proto-carousel.png* - This is a super bare-bones prototype of what your screenshot carousel should look like. We expect you to design and beautify the hell out of it :D

### Overall Premise and Expected Behavior
- Clicking on the right icon, takes you to the next screenshot, while clicking on the left takes you to the previous screenshot
- The screenshots should be continuous.. À la, if you click all the way through to the end of the series and click the next icon, you should be taken to the first screenshot in the series. Alternately, if you click on the previous icon when you’re on the very first screenshot, you should be taken to the last in the series

### What Skills are we Testing? 
- Interacting with dynamic content - We build out php templates in our Wordpress CMS where we've got to parse and insert dynamic user content. Parsing the json provided here in carouselData.js would demonstrate that you can work well in this environment.
- JS cleanliness - How did you organize your code and what did or didn’t you comment?
- Design - The iconage, image layout, and navigation buttons are designed by you. Are our designers happy with it?
- Efficiency - Did you develop beautifully simple, clean code.. that works?

### Bonus Points!
If you'd like to go above and beyond, we'll be impressed by the following:
- Make your widget responsive for tablet and handheld breakpoints
- Full cross-browser compatibility (yup, unfortunately this includes, IE8 through IE11 as well as Safari, Firefox, and Chrome)
- CSS3 Animations!

Good luck!
